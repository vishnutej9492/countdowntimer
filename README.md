## Tools

For this project, I decided to use Express + Angular + Node. The reason for using express is because its a lightweight and flexible node web application framework that has built in features with respect to routing that makes it easy to build single applications such as this one. AngularJS was used to extend the HTML and add functionality that is required to change the user interface of the web application to make it responsive to change in variables and such. I used Node JS for the server side of the web application even though for this particular example it is not exactly required, but it would mean that the application would be hostable and is required for future improvements of this type of an application with a vast expansion of libraries that can be implemented to improve back end features.

## Future Improvements

CSS Improvements- try to wrap every tag in classes that are unique to their function and refine the UI.

Various Countdowntimer Modes- Allow the user to input a certain date or time from a calendar picker and then process the data with an option to another end date rather than just the new year. Another improvement could be getting the current time from the client directly.

Animation for the Alert- Design and make the alert box more animated and possibly have a video / animation to celebrate the new year!

Code Commenting- Better and more vast code commenting so that the code is reusable and easily extendable.
